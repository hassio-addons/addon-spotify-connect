Play Spotify music on your Home Assistant device.

## About

The Home Assistant Spotify Connect add-on allows you to use your device
running Home Assistant to play your Spotify music. This add-on uses the
Spotify Connect protocol, which makes it show up a device that can be
controlled by all the official clients.

For example; Running Home Assistant on a Raspberry Pi with this add-on
installed will allow you to play your Spotify music via the Pi. So all
you'll have to do is hook up your sound system to the Pi!
