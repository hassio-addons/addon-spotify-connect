Play Spotify music on your Home Assistant device.

![The Spotify Connect Hass.io add-on](images/screenshot.png)

## About

The Hass.io Spotify Connect add-on allows you to use your device, running
Home Assistant, to play your Spotify music. This add-on uses the Spotify
Connect protocol, which makes it a device that can be controlled
by all the official clients.

For example; Running Hass.io on a Raspberry Pi with this add-on installed
will allow you to play your Spotify music on the Pi. So all you'll have
to do is hook up your sound system to the Pi and start booming!

## Installation

**IMPORTANT**: _This add-on requires a Spotify Premium account!_

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

1. [Add our Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your Hass.io instance.
1. Install the "Spotify Connect" add-on.
1. Put in your Spotify account details into the `username`/`password` options.
1. Click the `Save` button to store your credentials.
1. Select your audio output device and hit `Save` on that as well.
1. Start the "Spotify Connect" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "Spotify Connect" to see if everything went well.
1. Ready to go!

**NOTE**: Do not add this repository to Hass.io, please use:
`https://github.com/hassio-addons/repository`.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```json
{
  "log_level": "info",
  "username": "frenck@example.com",
  "password": "MySpotifyPassword",
  "name": "Hass.io",
  "bitrate": 320
}
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

Setting the `log_level` to `debug` will also turn on debug mode on the
Spotify service.

### Option: `username`

The username you use to login to your Spotify Premium account.

**Note**: _This option support secrets, e.g., `!secret spotify_username`._

### Option: `password`

The password you use to login to your Spotify Premium account.

**Note**: _This option support secrets, e.g., `!secret spotify_password`._

### Option: `name`

The name of your device (the Spotify Connect target), as shown on
the official Spotify clients.

**Note**: _May only contain letters, numbers, hyphens (`-`) and dots (`.`)

### Option: `bitrate`

The bitrate Spotify should use. The higher, the better the sound quality,
however, the add-on consumes more data.

Valid values: `96`, `160` (default) or `320`.

## Known issues and limitations

- This add-on does support ARM-based devices, nevertheless, they must
  at least be an ARMv7 device. (Raspberry Pi 1 and Zero is not supported).
- This add-on requires a Spotify Premium account.
